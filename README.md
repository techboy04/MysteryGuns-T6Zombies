# Mystery Guns - Plutonium T6 Zombies - Beta 0.1
I decided to make a little mode in Zombies.

I did make this mode a little rough on the edges but it should work pretty well.

IF YOURE PLAYING MOB OF THE DEAD:
You WILL need this fix or else the game will spam infinite loops. Use the ``mob_mysteryguns_fix.gsc`` in ``scripts\zm\zm_prison\``

After each round, you will be given a random weapon. If the previous weapon was upgraded, then the next weapon will also be upgraded.

Wallbuys and Mysteryboxes are unavailable.

By Default, there is no perk limit

## Installation
Download gungame.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)

You will have to open console and type in ```set enable_mysteryguns 1``` to enable this! This is so you can still have the script in your folder while also able to disable it if you want to use other mods!

## Got a Bug or a Suggestion?
As this mode is still being worked on, I accept suggestions and bugs. [Join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/dkwyDzW), Grab the Call of Duty role, and report it to [#technoops-forums](https://discord.com/channels/399600672586203137/1032884888468213811)
