# Mystery Guns - Plutonium T6 Zombies - 1.0
I decided to make a little mode in Zombies.

After each round, you will be given a random weapon. If the previous weapon was upgraded, then the next weapon will also be upgraded.

Wallbuys and Mysteryboxes are unavailable.

By Default, there is no perk limit

# Using the Mod version (Recommended)
## zm_gungame.zip

## Installation
Download zm_mysteryguns zip and put it in your Plutonium T6 mods folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\mods\```

# Using the Scripts version
## mysteryguns.gsc, and mob_mysteryguns_fix.gsc

## Installation
Download mysteryguns.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

Put mob_mysteryguns_fix.gsc in the zm_prison folder located in the scripts folder.

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\zm_prison```

(if the folder isnt there create them)

You will have to open console and type in ```set enable_mysteryguns 1``` to enable this! This is so you can still have the script in your folder while also able to disable it if you want to use other mods!
If youre using the mod version, you dont need to use the console! Its included in **Custom Games** menu!

## Configuration
This script lets you modify some features! On the mod version, these can be changed on the **Custom Games** menu instead!
- enable_mysteryguns - Toggle the mode, best used if you want to keep the mode in your scripts folder when using any other mods.
- mysteryguns_sharpshooter - Enables the Sharpshooter mode.
- sharpshooter_duration - How long between each weapon when Sharpshooter is enabled.
